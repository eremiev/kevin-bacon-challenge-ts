# Kevin Bacon Coding Challenge

Welcome! Your task is to provide the implementation for an application that determines the "degrees of separation" between Kevin Bacon and other actors. 

## Evaluation Criteria

* Does the application function as per the requirements?
* Do the packaged tests pass?
* Is the code well-organized, modularized, and easy to follow?
* Does the code check/handle error/edge conditions?
* Are additional unit tests provided to cover areas of complexity?

## Getting Started

* Unzip `kevin-bacon-challenge-ts.zip`.
* Run `npm install apeloquin-agilysys-imdb-simulator-1.0.0.tgz` to initialize the project.
* Explore the project and start your implementation.
* Run `npm test` to execute included tests that are expected to pass.

## Notes

* We will be evaluating your solution using **Node v18.13.0**.
* Unsurprisingly, files with the header `DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE` should be left alone.
* If you believe the test conditions in _index.test.ts_ to be inaccurate given the provided dataset, please provide your evidence with your submission.

## The Application

The application uses the IMDB API to find "degrees of separation" between Kevin Bacon and other actors.  We have provided a curated subset of IMDB API requests/responses via the included _imdb-simulator_ package.  

There are 3 shell commands which are detailed below. 

### load_kevin_bacons_history.sh

This command is used to explore the movie graph and persist data locally to be utilized by the other two shell commands. 

| Parameter | Value | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---|------|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --depth | 1-3  | true | Depth to explore the movie graph, where: <br/>_1_ includes only movies Kevin Bacon was in<br/>_2_ includes movies that Kevin Bacon's costars were in<br/>_3_ includes movies that Kevin Bacon's costars' costars were in |
| -v, --verbose | _N/A_ | false | Optional output (provided by you) to indicate what the application is doing during processing.                                                                                                                                 |


#### Example

```
$ ./load_kevin_bacons_history.sh --depth 1
78 actors tangentially connected to Kevin Bacon are loaded
```

### list_actors_names_we_now_know.sh

This command will list all actors identified in the previous _load_kevin_bacons_history.sh_ run by full name, alphabetically sorted.  It is expected that every name here will be recognized by the _degrees_away_from_kevin_bacon.sh_ command.

| Parameter | Value | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---|------|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -v, --verbose | _N/A_ | false | Optional output (provided by you) to indicate what the application is doing during processing.                                                                                                                                 |

#### Example
```
$ ./list_actors_names_we_now_know.sh 
AJ Zoldy
Aaron Pierre
Abbey Lee
Adaline Swanson
Adam Moryto
Ahmad Dugas
Aidan Bristow
Aisha Dee
Alana Jackson
```
Results in example are truncated for brevity, full list of actors should be provided in the output.

### degrees_away_from_kevin_bacon.sh

This command will look up the provided actor and identify the "degrees of separation" from Kevin Bacon, including the movies from the graph that define the degrees.

| Parameter        | Value  | Required | Description                                                                                    |
|------------------|--------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _{1st argument}_ | string | true     | Full name of actor to evaluate using **case-insensitive** matching.                            |
| -v, --verbose    | _N/A_  | false    | Optional output (provided by you) to indicate what the application is doing during processing. |

#### Examples

```
$ ./degress_away_from_kevin_bacon.sh "adaline swanson"
0 degrees
Space Oddity date 2022 Kevin Bacon, Adaline Swanson

$ ./degress_away_from_kevin_bacon.sh "Chris Johnson"
2 degrees
One Way date 2022 Kevin Bacon, Storm Reid
Missing date 2023 Storm Reid, Kimberly Cheng
Peppermint date 2018 Kimberly Cheng, Chris Johnson

```

## Submission

* We expect a response from you within 48 hours or so.  No worries if youâ€™re not able to fully complete the challenge.  Please time box your efforts.  Working code we can test is highly preferred.
* In `submission.md`, write a statement on what is done, not working, unknown. This helps us understand what it will be like to work together. 
* Provide a ZIP archive of the project _without **node_modules**_ named _{firstName-lastName}-kevin-bacon-challenge-ts.zip_.
